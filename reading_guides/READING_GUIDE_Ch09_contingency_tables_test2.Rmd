## CHAPTER 9: CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS: Associations between categorical variables

I don't emphasize this chapter because a) contingency tables are usually covered in intro stats courses and b) I want to get to **logistic regression** by the end of the course, which represents a more contemporary approach to the analysis of categorical data.  There are several general aspects of the analysis of categorical data using contingency tables and the chi^2 test that I do want students to know.  I highlight the relevant sections from the book below.  Overall I want you to know what a contginecy table is, how to identify the response and predictors with this type of data, and that chi^2 tests and logistic regression are used to analyze this type of data.  I did not discuss any of the calcualtions related to chi^2 tests, or even discuss how to do it in R.  Because of this, I don't indicate which sections can be skipped - unless listed below, a section can be skipped.

#### Examples of categorical resposne variables

The authors list several types of categorical data on page 235 - these are good examples to understand.

**Contingency analysis** "estimates and tests for an association between two or more categorical variables" (pg 236).

In R-like code, this would be
categorical.response ~ categorical.predictor

#### Example 9.3: Your litter box and your brain

You should be able to recognize this type of data as being categorical data which can be analyized using a contingency table or chi^2 test (or also logistic regression).

#### Table 9.3-1

You should be able to recognize this type of data as being categorical data which can be analyized using a contingency table or chi^2 test (or also logistic regression).

### 9.4 The Chi^2 contingency test

Also just called the chi^2 test.  You should read this section from page 246-247.

#### Example 9.4: The gnarly worm gets the bird

You should be able to recognize this type of data as being categorical data which can be analyized using a contingency table or chi^2 test (or also logistic regression).  I discussed this example in lecture.

#### Hypotheses

I did not phrase the hypothesis like this; I said soemthing more like 

* Ho: parasite infection is not related to being eaten
* Ha: paraiste infection is related to being eaten

Instead o "is related to" one could say "predicts" , eg, "parasite infection predicts whether a fish is eaten or not""

#### Example 9.5: The feeding habits of vampire bats

You should be able to recognize this type of data as being categorical data which can be analyized using a contingency table or chi^2 test (or also logistic regression).
