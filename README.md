# Companion_to_Analysis_of_Bio_Data
Teaching materials related to Whitlock &amp; Shulter's "Analysis of Biological Data" 2nd ed.

This repo contains annotated outlines of the chapters I lecture on in my course "Design & Analysis of Ecological Data" 
at California University of Pennsylvania.  This course focuses on the key concepts of experimental design, t-tests,
1-way ANOVA and regression with a major emphasis on implementation in R.  This course does not focus on calculation by hand.
